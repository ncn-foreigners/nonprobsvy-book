# Mass imputation

## Motivation and assumptions

## Model-based methods

This method is based on parametric model on sample $S_A$ in the form of

$$
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}\left(y_i \mid \bx_i\right) = m\left(\bx_i, \bbeta_{0}\right)
\end{equation}
$$ 

for some unknown $\bbeta_{0}$ and known function $m(\cdot)$. The specification of m-function typically follows the mean function for generalized linear models. If $\by$ is continous, we can use linear regression model with $m\left(\boldsymbol{x}_i, \bbeta_{0}\right) = \bx_i^{T} \bbeta_0$. If $\by$ is binary, one can use logistic regression model and let $m\left(\boldsymbol{x}_i, \bbeta_{0}\right) = \frac{\exp\left( \bx_i^{T} \bbeta_0\right)}{\exp\left( \bx_i^{T} \bbeta_0\right) + 1}$. If $\by$ represents count data, we can use log-linear model, where $m\left(\boldsymbol{x}_i, \bbeta_{0}\right) = \exp\left(\bx_i^{T} \bbeta_0\right)$

Mass imputation estimator 

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\hat{N}^{\mathrm{B}}} \sum_{i \in \mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{B}}} d_i^{\mathrm{B}} m\left(\boldsymbol{x}_i, \hat{\bbeta}\right)
\end{equation}

## Nearest neighbor imputation

### Assumptions

### model
On the other hand we can applied non-parametric method to this problem, such as nearest neighbor algorithm, that is, find the closest matching unit from sample $S_B$ based on the $\bX$ values and use the corresponding $\bY$ value from this unit as the imputed value. Procedure contains two steps

1. for each $i \in S_B$ find the nearest neighbor from sample $S_A$.

2. Calculate the nearest neighbor imputation estimator of $\mu_y$
$$
\begin{equation}
\hat{\mu}_\mathrm{nn}=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i \in S_B} d_i^B y_{i(1)} .
\end{equation}
$$

### K-nearest neighbor imputation
Steps

1. For each unit $i \in S_B$ find k-nearest neighbors from sample $S_A$. Impute the $\bY$ value for unit $i$ by $\hat{\mu}\left(\mathbf{X}_i\right)=k^{-1} \sum_{j=1}^k Y_{i(j)}$.
2. Calculate k-nearest neighbor imputation estimator of $\mu_y$
$$
\hat{\mu}_{\mathrm{knn}}=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i \in S_B} d_i^B \hat{\mu}\left(\mathbf{X}_i\right) .
